-- target below is a share of it, and the row that actually decides whether the widget
-- survives is `theme.*`: the worst pass of a theme plus the full sweep of the tree it
-- leaves standing.
--
-- `target` is what the check enforces. `measured` is what the row cost when it was written
-- -- kept so that a number which has moved is visible even while it is still inside its
-- target. `proposed` is the figure that sat on the row before anything had been measured;
-- where it differs from `target` the report says so on every run, so a re-apportioned
-- budget can never pass for the original one.

-- estimated: `lua5.3 bin/accounting/measure.lua --emit` prints the table body of a run.

    -- on how many answers the link happened to deliver into it. The margin here is the check's

    -- not read the old one: the chips carry letters, every row names the trim that drives it, the
