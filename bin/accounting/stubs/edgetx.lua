-- modules, and the layout figures the lvgl table carries. The suite asks for every one of them
-- behind a type() test, and an absent name takes the branch of a radio that does not offer it --
-- which is not the branch an EdgeTX 2.12 colour radio takes. A page priced without them is priced
-- on a path no pilot runs, and nothing in the report would say so.
--
-- Installed by measure.lua for the tool's scenario only, after install() has built that world. The
-- dashboard reads several of the same names -- getRSSI in four places -- and every other row was
-- written on a world without them, so install() takes them away again for the next world.
--

-- which the suite asks for where another platform has them and replaces with dir() here; GREY_DARK;
-- and every key name but the exit key's two events. EdgeTX 2.12 exports no KEY_* or EVT_KEY_*
