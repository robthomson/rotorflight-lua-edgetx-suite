"""Report the strings a locale build cannot translate.

`GEMINI.md` asks for i18n on every string. Nothing could see a breach of it. A hardcoded
English label compiles under `luac`, leaves no `@i18n(...)@` marker for the packager to
resolve, produces no warning from `.vscode/scripts/resolve_i18n_tags.py`, and draws
perfectly on the radio -- in English, in every locale. The same is true of a translated
call whose key is assembled at runtime: the precompiler cannot follow it, so it rewrites
nothing and the English fallback ships everywhere.

Two classes, and they are treated differently on purpose.

  assembled key   A call to `t`, `tr` or `i18n.t` whose key is built rather than written:
                  `t("app.onconnect." .. name)`, `tr(prefix .. key)`,
                  `state.i18n.t(entry.key)`. Every substitution in
                  `.vscode/scripts/precompile_i18n.py` needs the key to be a complete
                  quoted literal, so an assembled one is never resolved.

  untranslated    A literal in a place a pilot reads it -- a `label`, `title`, `message`
                  or one of the other text fields of a table, or the label argument of a
                  `Controls.append*` helper -- that never reaches the translator.

Both are REPORTED rather than refused, and each is held at a baseline below: the check
fails when a number grows, not because it is not zero. A check that started red on the
tree it was written for would only teach everybody to ignore it.

The one assembled key the tree carries today is `Header.tAction` in `src/rfsuite/ui/header.lua`,
and it is a wrapper rather than a defect: the precompiler rewrites its five call sites --
`t("back", "BACK")` and its siblings -- into finished `@i18n(...)@` markers, so after a
packaged build the function has no caller at all and its body never runs. That was checked
by precompiling the file and counting the callers, not by reading it. It stays as the
baseline; a second one would be a finding.

The report is the useful half. It groups by literal and sorts by how often each occurs,
because the work is concentrated: a handful of literals account for a third of the total,
and translating those clears far more than walking the files would.

Names are not words. `BLHeli_S` and `CRSF` are the same string in every language, so they
live in `bin/i18n/allowed_untranslated.txt` and are never reported. Adding a line there is
a decision that a string is a name; a word that merely appears often is not one.

    python bin/i18n/check_translations.py             # report, and the ratchet
    python bin/i18n/check_translations.py --report    # report only, never fails
    python bin/i18n/check_translations.py --self-test # the control
