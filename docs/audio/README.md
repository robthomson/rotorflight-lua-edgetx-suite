# Audio

The release archive installs the announcement pack under `/SOUNDS/rf/`, one folder per
language, and the switches are under *System* → *Settings* → *Audio* → *Events*. These files
say what each announcement means and when it fires.

| File | What it will say | Start from | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`events.md`](events.md) | Every announcement by category (Arming, Governor, Voltage, Profiles, ESC, Adjustments, Fuel, Battery, Link, Other): its switch, its default, what triggers it, and which settings are per model. Ends with the sound-pack files an announcement asks for. | in-app help of the ten category pages | written |
| `sound-pack.md` | Where the pack installs, the language fallback, and how to replace a file. | README | to write |
| `model-name.md` | Announcing the model by name: the file to place under `/SOUNDS/`, its naming, and the switch that plays it. | README | to write |
