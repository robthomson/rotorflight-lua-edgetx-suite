# Quick menu

The screen the dashboard widget shows when it is put full screen: a short list of things a
pilot wants to reach from the flight line without leaving the dashboard for the tool.

## Where to find it

Put the *RFSuite* widget full screen the way EdgeTX puts any widget full screen — the widget's
own context menu on the screen it sits on, then *Full screen*. The quick menu is what full
screen shows; there is no other way in and no way for the widget to open it by itself.

A dashboard theme can take full screen for itself instead (a theme author's choice, see
[dashboard themes](../developer/dashboard-themes.md#a-theme-that-takes-fullscreen)). Full screen
then shows the theme, and the quick menu opens over it from the theme's menu control or with
the page keys.

One exception is the [in-flight tuning overlay](inflight-tuning.md): while the interlock
switch has brought it up, it takes full screen instead and the quick menu is not drawn.

The other is the battery prompt. With *Ask which pack after connecting* on (the
[Flight Log](../pages/tools/flight_log.md) page, *Settings*), full screen shows the battery
picker instead of the quick menu once per connection, until the pilot has picked a pack,
closed it or armed the model.

The menu's colours are the radio's, not the dashboard theme's. It uses the same theme colours
EdgeTX gives every script, so it looks the same whichever dashboard theme is selected.

## What it offers

| Entry | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **ERASE BLACKBOX** | Asks first, because the erase cannot be undone — see [the erase confirmation](#the-erase-confirmation). Its **ERASE** answer erases the flight controller's blackbox storage, then reads the storage summary back so the dashboard shows the free space it has now, closes the menu and leaves full screen (over a theme that takes full screen: closes the menu and shows the theme again). |
| **IN-FLIGHT TUNING** | Opens the in-flight tuning surface at full size. It stays full screen rather than closing. Only listed while the feature is switched on — see below. |
| **BATTERY** | Brings the battery prompt back, with this model's packs. It stays full screen, the picker taking the menu's place. Only listed while the battery registry has a pack for this model and the model is disarmed. |
| **MAIN MENU** | Opens the suite's tool, with its whole menu, inside the widget — see [the tool from full screen](#the-tool-from-full-screen). Only listed while the model is disarmed. |
| **FLIGHT LOG** | Opens the suite's tool inside the widget on its [Flight Log](../pages/tools/flight_log.md) page; the back key there closes it again. Not in the menu as it comes — the pilot adds it on the *Quick Settings* page — and then only listed while the *Flight Log* preview is on and the model is disarmed. |
| **BATTERY PROFILE** | A grid of the model's battery profiles; pressing one makes it the profile in force. |

That is the menu as it comes, *FLIGHT LOG* aside. Which of these entries it shows, and in which order, is the
pilot's to choose on *System* → *Settings* → *Dashboard* →
[*Quick Settings*](../pages/settings/dashboard/quick_menu.md). An entry chosen there still hides
where the table says it is not listed.

**IN-FLIGHT TUNING is a preview entry.** It appears only while *System* → *Settings* →
*General* → *Preview* → *In-flight tuning* is on **and** the widget is carrying the overlay's
state for this model. With the preview switch off the entry is not listed at all, so the menu
offers no route into a feature the widget has stopped driving. What the surface itself does is
in [in-flight tuning](inflight-tuning.md); the screen it opens sends nothing until the
interlock switch is thrown.

## The erase confirmation

Erasing the blackbox is irreversible and sits one tap from the flight line, so the row asks
before it acts. Tapping **ERASE BLACKBOX** opens a question over the menu: a title, a sentence
naming what is about to go, and, where the flight controller has reported the storage summary
(on connecting, and after every erase), a line saying how full it is as *% used*. **ERASE** is
on the right, in the warning colour; **CANCEL** is on the left.

Nothing is sent and full screen is not left until **ERASE** is pressed. **CANCEL** does nothing
and shows the menu again; a short press on the return key does the same while a theme takes full
screen, and on a radio whose return key leaves full screen the question is discarded with the
visit. Either way the logs are left alone. A model that has not reported a summary yet is asked
the same question without the *% used* line.

## The tool from full screen

EdgeTX gives a widget no way to start a tool script, so the dashboard opens the tool itself: it
runs the same tool inside the widget, at full screen, until it is closed, and then shows the
theme again — or, over a theme that does not take full screen, this menu. A view of the theme's
that was showing, or that the pilot had closed, does not come back on its own when the tool is
closed. It is reached three ways, all of them only while the model is disarmed:

- **MAIN MENU** in the quick menu, and **FLIGHT LOG**, which opens it on its *Flight Log* page;
- the tool control — three slider lines — beside the menu control, over a theme that takes full
  screen and binds no control of its own;
- the same control on the connect screen, when the widget is put full screen before the link is
  up, so the tool is there for a model that does not connect.

While it is open the tool works as it does when started from the radio's tool list, on the
widget's own connection to the flight controller. The return key at the top of its menu closes
it, and so does the return key on the *Flight Log* page where *FLIGHT LOG* opened it there. Arming the model closes it as well, because while it is open the dashboard does not run and
nothing is announced. So does leaving full screen with a long press on the return key. In both
cases the tool's own closing sequence runs, so a page's changes that were already sent still
reach the flight controller.

Two things are different from the tool started from the tool list:

- **A page that builds a lot can take a moment longer to appear.** A widget is stopped when one
  call runs too long, where the tool started from the tool list is paused and resumed, so such a
  page is finished over the next few frames.
- **Some memory stays in use after it is closed.** The pages are released, but the parts of the
  tool the dashboard shares stay loaded until the widget is.

## The battery profile grid

One button per battery profile the flight controller carries a capacity for — profiles 1 to 6,
and a profile whose capacity is zero is left out rather than shown as an empty one. Each button
is labelled with that profile's capacity in mAh, and the profile the flight controller reports
is highlighted. Which one that is comes from the *BatP* telemetry sensor; a model that is not
sending it keeps the last profile that was read, and profile 1 until one has been read at all.

Pressing a capacity sets that battery profile on the flight controller and writes the setting
to the board's own storage, which is what makes the board apply the change and tell the rest of
the radio about it. The menu then closes and leaves full screen, or, over a theme that takes
full screen, shows the theme again.

The grid is two buttons wide, one wide on a narrow widget zone, and three wide on a screen at
least 400 pixels across when there are more than four profiles, so all six still fit below the
entries above it. It stops at the bottom edge of the screen: a profile whose button would not
fit is not drawn.

## Closing it

The **X** in the header closes the menu and leaves full screen. So does every entry except
in-flight tuning, BATTERY, MAIN MENU and FLIGHT LOG, which swap one full-screen surface for another. The battery
picker's packs, *NO BATTERY* and its own X leave full screen as well, and the next entry into
full screen shows the quick menu, with BATTERY to bring the picker back. EdgeTX's own way out of
full screen — a long press on the return key — works as it does anywhere else.

Over a theme that takes full screen, the same X, entries and picker answers close what is open
and show the theme again instead; the theme's own close control, or a long press on the return
key, leaves full screen. On a radio with page keys, PAGE opens and closes the menu there, and a
short press on the return key closes the menu or the picker.

## For contributors

The menu's content is a list rather than drawing code. `M.entries(widget)` in
`src/rfsuite/widgets/dashboard/fullscreen_menu.lua` returns it, and
`M.build(children, widget, entries)` draws whatever list it is given; with the third argument
omitted it draws `M.entries(widget)`, which is what the dashboard runtime asks for.

An entry carries the vocabulary `src/rfsuite/app/manifest.lua` already uses for the tool's own
menus:

| Key | What it says |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | The entry's name, for anything that has to refer to it. |
| `title` | The text on the row, already translated. |
| `kind` | `action` for a single button, `choice` for a title over a grid of options. |
| `view` | For a `choice` whose options are drawn by a view of their own: that view's id. The menu then draws the row as the single button that opens it (its `after`), and the view draws the options. |
| `visibleWhen` | The name of a condition that decides whether the row exists at all. Omitted, the row is always there. |
| `press` | The work an `action` does when it is pressed, and nothing else. Optional: a row whose whole effect is its `after` has none. |
| `after` | What follows the press, as data: `done`, `openView:<id>`, `closeView`, `exitFullscreen`, `openTool` or `none`. Missing means `none`. The actions are described in [dashboard views](../developer/dashboard-views.md). |
| `confirm` | Optional, the question the row asks before its press is performed: a table of already-translated strings — `title`, `message`, the optional `detail`, and the labels `confirmLabel` and `cancelLabel`. Present, the press is held until the pilot answers — see [the erase confirmation](#the-erase-confirmation). |
| `options` | For a `choice`: a list, or a function returning one, of `{ id, label, current, press, after }`. `id` is what a run is matched by: a battery profile's number, 1 to 6, and a pack's registry id. The battery-profile grid is one, and the battery picker's packs are the other. |
| `close` | Optional, `{ press, after }`: what closing the surface that draws the options does. |
| `info` | Optional, a function returning what the entry knows about the state it acts on, read when it is called. ERASE BLACKBOX has one: `{ used, total }` of the blackbox, from the summary the flight controller last sent. |

`M.entry(widget, id)` returns one entry of the list, building that one only, and `M.run(widget, entry, option, after,
report)` runs it: the work — the option's `press` when an option is given, else the entry's —
and then its `after`, or the `after` given in its place. It is the one place both happen, for
the menu's own buttons, the picker's and a theme's. `report` is handed to the work: an entry
that sends messages to the flight controller queues them as one chain and reports on the chain
through it (`"busy"`, then `"ok"` on the last message's reply or `"failed"` on any message's
error). The menu's own buttons pass none, so what they queue is what they always queued.

**Menus are lists of entry ids.** `M.LISTS` names them — `quick` is the quick menu's default,
`erase_blackbox`, `inflight_tuning`, `battery_pick`, `tool`, `battery_profile` — and
`M.list(widget, name)` returns the entries of one. For `quick` that is the pilot's list rather
than the default: `M.entries(widget)` and `M.list(widget, "quick")` read the ids from the
`dashboard.quick_menu` preference through `src/rfsuite/widgets/dashboard/quick_menu_order.lua`,
which also holds the entries a pilot may choose (`OFFERED`), the default (`DEFAULT`) and their
titles for the settings page, so the page and the menu cannot disagree. The preference is a
string of ids separated by commas: absent, or not a string, is the default; the empty string is
an emptied menu; an id the build does not offer is dropped, and an id named twice counts at its
first place. A string that names nothing the build offers reads as the default. An entry added
to the menu is added to `OFFERED` there, and to `DEFAULT` only where an unconfigured radio
should show it. `M.resolve(widget, entry, option)` finds
the menu's own record and option for what a caller hands in, by `id`, and
`M.coreList(widget, list)` the records for a list of them — every entry the menu can build, not
only the ones in the pilot's list, so a theme that names an entry gets it. A theme reaches the same records
through its `ctx` and may draw them its own way, but it adds none and changes none: see
[dashboard themes](../developer/dashboard-themes.md#the-theme-draws-the-widget-acts).

**BATTERY is the battery prompt's record.** `battery_pick` is a `choice` with `view =
"battery_pick"`: in the menu it is the BATTERY button, and the battery picker
(`widgets/dashboard/battery_pick_menu.lua`) is the view that draws its options. They are one per
pack this model has — `label` the pack's name, `detail` the capacity and profile line under it,
`pack` the registry entry, `id` its registry id, `current` for the pack picked this connection
— and a last one marked `none`, *NO BATTERY*. Each records the pick and is followed by `done`. Its `close` ends the
prompt for this connection, which is what the picker's X and a short press on RTN do. What a
pick does is therefore written in one place, the record; the picker is only its drawing.
`options()` needs no argument: the widget is the one the list was made for.

Two things are worth knowing before adding an entry:

- **A title is resolved in `entries()`, from a complete literal key.** The translation
  precompiler rewrites the keys it can read and leaves alone the ones it cannot, so a key
  assembled from parts ships the English fallback in every language with nothing reporting it.
- **A `visibleWhen` name is resolved in `src/rfsuite/widgets/dashboard/views.lua`, and an
  unknown name hides its row** — the same way an unresolvable condition hides a tool menu entry
  in `src/rfsuite/app/menu_registry.lua`. It is the same list a fullscreen view's `openWhen`
  is resolved against. `enabledWhen` and `lockedWhileArmed` belong to the same vocabulary and no
  entry uses one yet, so the first entry that needs one brings its resolver with it. `confirm`
  is the first that did: an entry that carries one has its press held by `views.lua` until the
  pilot has answered, and run from that answer.
