# User themes

RFSuite loads dashboard themes from two folders: the shipped ones from `/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/rfsuite-core/widgets/dashboard/themes/`, and yours from the user folder at `/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/rfsuite.user/dashboard/`. A theme folder goes directly in there — `/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/rfsuite.user/dashboard/mytheme/init.lua`, with no `themes` level in between.

Both folders are listed, so a theme in the user folder is an additional choice in the theme selector under *System* → *Settings* → *Dashboard* → *Design* rather than a replacement: a copy that keeps the original's `name` appears in the list twice, once for each folder. Give a copy a name of its own.

## Structure of a theme

A theme is a folder containing an `init.lua` manifest and one module per flight phase:

- `init.lua`: the theme's name, the file name of each of the three phase modules and of the two optional ones below, optionally the configuration page (`configure.lua`), and optionally `fullscreen = "theme"`, which makes full screen show the theme itself, with the quick menu opening over it, instead of the quick menu ([details](../developer/dashboard-themes.md#a-theme-that-takes-fullscreen)). Those are the only keys that are read.
- `preflight.lua`: layout and boxes shown on the ground, before arming.
- `inflight.lua`: layout and boxes shown once the model is flying.
- `postflight.lua`: summary boxes shown after a flight, from the disarm onwards.

Two further modules are optional, and a theme that does not carry them loses nothing:

- `armed.lua`: shown from the arm until the model spools up. Without it that phase shows `preflight.lua`.
- `offline.lua`: shown after a flight once the flight controller has stopped answering — an unplugged battery, or the model out of range. Without it that phase shows `postflight.lua`.
- `icon.png`: the picture the theme selector draws for the theme. A theme without one is still selectable and shows an empty tile.

Each phase module returns a table with `layout` options (margins, grid dimensions) and a list of `boxes`.

Which module is on screen is not a setting: the widget computes the phase from the flight controller's own telemetry, and arming alone does not put the model in flight. [Adding a dashboard theme](../developer/dashboard-themes.md) gives the manifest keys, the exact phase triggers and the full box vocabulary.

## Box types and text styling

Themes define objects such as gauges (`type = "gauge"`), telemetry text (`type = "text"`), clocks and timers (`type = "time"`), and battery/governor status indicators.

### Text colors

Text boxes configure their default font color via `textcolor`. This property accepts:
- Numeric 16-bit RGB values (e.g. from `lcd.RGB(r, g, b)`).
- EdgeTX theme color constants (e.g. `COLOR_WHITE`, `COLOR_BLACK`).
- Named color strings: `"white"`, `"black"`, `"red"`, `"green"`, `"blue"`, `"yellow"`, `"orange"`, `"cyan"`, `"magenta"`, and `"grey"`.

```lua
{
  type = "text",
  source = "rpm",
  label = "RPM",
  textcolor = "orange",
}
```

### Dynamic color thresholds

Both gauges and text boxes support a `thresholds` list. When telemetry values update, the box evaluates the thresholds and updates its text or accent color reactively:

#### Numeric thresholds
For numeric sources (e.g. `rpm`, `bec_voltage`, `temp_esc`, `altitude`, `flight_time`, `blackbox`), thresholds are specified as a table ordered by trigger values:

```lua
{
  type = "text",
  source = "bec_voltage",
  label = "BEC",
  thresholds = {
    { value = 6.5, textcolor = "red" },
    { value = 7.0, textcolor = "orange" },
    { value = 8.5, textcolor = "white" },
  }
}
```

Thresholds are evaluated in order (`value <= threshold.value`). Gauge fill thresholds use `fillcolor` (or `color`), while text and value labels use `textcolor` (or `color`). An entry can declare either or both. If no threshold matches, the default `textcolor` is used.

For temperature sources (`esc_temp`, `temp_esc`, `mcu_temp`, `temp_mcu`), threshold values are defined in Celsius (°C) in the theme and automatically converted when the radio is configured for Fahrenheit (°F).

#### When a threshold is resolved

A `value`, a `textcolor` and a `fillcolor` may each be given as a function, so that a limit can
come out of the theme's own configuration rather than being written into the box:

```lua
{
  type = "gauge",
  subtype = "arc",
  source = "bec_voltage",
  thresholds = {
    { value = function(_, state) return (state.themeConfig or {}).bec_warn or 6.0 end, fillcolor = "red" },
    { value = 1000, fillcolor = "green" },
  }
}
```

The list is resolved **once, when the box is built**, and the box then matches every value it is
given against the list that resolution produced. So anything such a function reads has to be
something that rebuilds the screen when it changes. The theme configuration is: saving it reloads
the active theme, which builds the boxes again. Live telemetry is not, and does not belong in a
threshold limit -- the box already re-evaluates the whole list against the current reading on
every change, which is what thresholds are for.

The same holds for the named colour strings above: they are mapped to a colour number when the
box is built, not on the first reading that arrives.

#### Governor state thresholds
For governor status boxes (`type = "text"`, `source = "governor"`), thresholds can match against governor state labels:

```lua
{
  type = "text",
  source = "governor",
  label = "GOV",
  thresholds = {
    { value = "DISARMED", textcolor = "grey" },
    { value = "SPOOLING", textcolor = "orange" },
    { value = "ACTIVE", textcolor = "green" },
    { value = "RECOVERY", textcolor = "red" },
  }
}
```

Values match either translated labels or internal state names, ensuring custom color schemes function across all radio languages.

In governor modes OFF and LIMIT the flight controller keeps no governor state, so while the model is armed the box shows the mode instead, and its internal names are `MODE_OFF` and `MODE_LIMIT`. A threshold on a state name such as `OFF` does not match there.

## Notes

- User themes in `/SCRIPTS/TOOLS/rfsuite.user/` are preserved across suite updates.
- If a theme includes a `configure.lua` file, its configurable options (such as voltage ranges) are saved in the radio's preferences as the standard values, and a model with per-model settings switched on keeps the values it changes in its own file. See [Settings](../pages/settings/dashboard/settings.md).
- If a theme breaks while its screen is being drawn, the widget tries three times, then shows *Dashboard error* instead of the dashboard and stops trying. Choosing another theme, changing a setting, reconnecting the flight controller or a flight phase with a screen of its own makes it try again; until then *Dashboard error* stays, which in flight can be until the end of the flight. [Adding a dashboard theme](../developer/dashboard-themes.md) says where the error is logged.
