# Per-Model Settings

The theme settings the connected model uses instead of the standard ones. The page opens the
settings of each theme the model draws for this model alone, and below that lists every setting
the model changes, next to the standard value it replaces, and lets each of them be reset.

## Where to find it

*System* → *Settings* → *Dashboard* → *Settings* → *Per-Model Settings*, the first tile of that grid.

The tile is there only while a flight controller is connected and per-model settings are on for
its model: *Allow per-model settings* and *Own settings for this model* on
[*Design*](theme.md), or — on a card that has not stored those switches yet — a model that
already has a theme or theme settings of its own. The grid checks this when it is opened, so a
switch turned on under *Design* shows the tile the next time the grid is entered.

## Settings

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| *Model:* and the name | The model the page is about: the craft name the flight controller reports, or the radio's model name where it reports none. |
| *(one row per theme the model draws)* | Under *Edit for this model*. The flight phases the theme is drawn in — *All flight phases*, or the phases it covers when *Per-Phase Themes* gives a phase a theme of its own — and a button with the theme's name that opens its settings for this model. The settings page's first line reads *Own settings for this model*. |
| *(one row per setting)* | Under *Different from standard*. The theme, the setting and the model's value, followed by the standard value it replaces — *standard* and the radio's value, or *theme default* where the radio has none. |
| Reset | Removes this one value from the model. The model then uses the standard value, and follows it when the standard changes later. Saved at once. |
| Reset all | Removes every theme setting of the model, after asking. Saved at once. |

Only the themes this model draws are listed: its own theme for each phase, or the standard theme
where it has none. A setting of any other theme would be stored and never shown. When none of
them has settings, the page says so.

With no setting to show, the page says the model uses the standard values.

## Notes

- **Only what differs is stored.** Saving a theme's page for this model stores the values that
  differ from the standard — the radio's value where it has one, the theme's default otherwise —
  and removes the ones that are equal. The list therefore shows what the model changes, and a
  later change of the standard reaches every value the model does not change.
- A card from an earlier version stored every value of a theme saved while a flight controller
  was connected, so its list can show rows whose value equals the standard. Saving that theme
  once from here, or resetting the rows, removes them.
- A reset does not turn per-model settings off: the model keeps *Own settings for this model* on, and its
  theme choice on *Design* is not touched. Turning them off is done on *Design*, and keeps
  the values.
- A row whose theme is no longer installed is still listed, as *Theme not installed*, so it can be
  reset.
- The page needs the flight controller. When the connection is lost the tool returns to the
  start screen; a theme page opened for the model that is left without the model's file refuses
  to save rather than writing into the standard values.
