# Model

Settings the flight controller stores for this model: three parameters it applies to the
radio's timers or global variables on connect, and the radio-side features it asks for.
They are stored on the board, so they travel with the helicopter rather than with the radio,
and a second radio flying the same craft gets them too.

## Where to find it

*Configuration* → *Setup* → *Model*

Greyed out until the flight controller answers. Read-only while the model is armed.

## Settings

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Parameter 1 to 3 Type | What the slot sets on the radio when the flight controller connects: *None*, one of the radio's three timers (*Timer 1* to *Timer 3*), or a global variable (*GV1* to *GV9*). |
| Parameter 1 to 3 Value | The value written into that timer or global variable. -32000 to 32000; greyed out while the slot's type is *None*. |
| Synchronize Model Parameters | Whether this radio applies the three parameters on connect at all. Stored on this radio, for every model. |
| Set Model Name on the Radio | Whether the radio's model is renamed after the craft name the flight controller reports. From MSP API 12.09 the flight controller carries this decision and the switch writes it there; on older firmware the switch is a preference of this radio and applies to every model. Only one of the two is ever shown. |

## Notes

- Saving writes the parameters and the model-name flag to the flight controller; the two
  radio-wide switches are saved on the radio.
- The rename is temporary. The model's own name is put back when the craft disconnects, or at
  the next start if the radio was switched off while connected. The dashboard widget (or the
  service widget) does both, not the configuration tool: a link that drops and comes back while
  the tool is open leaves the craft name in place, and one that is still down when the tool is
  closed is put back by the widget then.
- A model that carries neither the dashboard widget nor the service widget any more when the craft
  disconnects keeps the craft name; the configuration tool does not put it back. The model's own
  name stays recorded: once one of the two widgets is on the model again, it puts the name back the
  first time it runs without a link.
- The announcements at connect (the model name, the initial fuel) are switched under
  *System* → *Settings* → *Audio* → *Events*, not here.
