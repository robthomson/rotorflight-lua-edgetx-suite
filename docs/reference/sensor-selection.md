# How a value finds its telemetry sensor

The suite asks for values by what they are -- fuel, voltage, headspeed, current, link quality --
and the radio holds telemetry sensors with four-character names. This page is what sits between
the two: how a value is matched to one of the model's sensors, how long that choice lasts, and
why a sensor the radio has never sent is not taken for a reading of zero.

It applies everywhere a telemetry value is used: the dashboard widget, the audio announcements,
the flight log and the flight record.

## Choosing a sensor

Each value has a list of sensor names, most preferred first -- fuel is looked for as `Bat%`,
then `Fuel`, then `fuel`. The list is tried in order and the first name that answers is taken.
That choice is then remembered, so later passes read the chosen sensor directly instead of
searching again.

Where a value has been matched to something other than the first name on its list, the first name
is re-tried every few seconds, and the value moves back to it as soon as it starts answering.
That covers a sensor which appears late -- the flight controller's own values arrive a moment
after the link comes up, and two of them the suite publishes itself.

A value the model carries no sensor for at all -- no altimeter, no BEC voltage, no ESC
temperature -- would otherwise be searched for on every pass, for the whole flight. Those searches
are spaced out instead: the first retry comes after about two seconds and the wait doubles up to
half a minute.

## Asking for a sensor by its own name

Everything above is about the suite's own values, each with a list of names behind it. A name
that is not one of those -- a flight controller sensor the suite has no value for, or one of the
link statistics -- is read straight from the model's sensor of that name, and the same spacing
applies: a name the model carries no sensor for is retried after about two seconds and then less
and less often, not on every pass.

Two things come with that.

**The session minimum and maximum.** The radio keeps the lowest and the highest reading of every
sensor, and offers them under the sensor's name with a trailing `-` or `+`: `Hspd+` is the
highest headspeed, `RQly-` the worst link quality. They are the radio's figures rather than the
suite's, so they cover everything received since the radio last reset telemetry -- when the model
was loaded, when the radio was switched on, or on *Reset Telemetry* -- and not one flight.
[Flight statistics](flight-statistics.md) are the per-flight ones. One oddity is worth knowing:
on a **voltage** sensor the radio resets the minimum whenever a new maximum arrives, on the
assumption that a higher voltage means a fresh battery.

**The link statistics are the radio's sensors, not the flight controller's.** The CRSF driver
creates them from the link frames themselves, so they are there on every model flown on a
Crossfire or ELRS link, whether or not a flight controller is answering:

| Name | Unit | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1RSS`, `2RSS` | dBm | Signal strength at the receiver, per antenna. |
| `RQly` | % | Link quality up to the aircraft -- the share of packets that arrived. |
| `RSNR` | dB | Signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. |
| `ANT` | — | Which receiver antenna is active. |
| `RFMD` | — | The RF mode, as the module's own number. |
| `TPWR` | mW | Transmit power the module is using. |
| `TRSS` | dBm | Signal strength of the downlink, at the radio. |
| `TQly` | % | Link quality down from the aircraft. |
| `TSNR` | dB | Signal-to-noise ratio at the radio. |
| `RRSP`, `TRSP` | % | The two signal strengths again as percentages, where the module sends them. |
| `RPWR` | dBm | The receiver's transmit power, where the module sends it. |
| `TFPS` | Hz | Downlink frame rate, where the module sends it. |

Which of them a model actually has is the module's decision and not the suite's; the last four
come from extended frames that only some modules send. The units are those of EdgeTX 2.12.3 and
later; 2.12.2 and earlier declared the three signal strengths in dB. The flight controller's own
custom sensors are a separate set and are described under
[telemetry sensors](telemetry-sensors.md).

## Why a sensor the radio has never sent is not a reading of zero

A model keeps the sensors it has ever seen. Load a model that flew with a sensor the radio is no
longer receiving -- the value was switched off in the flight controller's telemetry set, an ESC
that is not on the bus today, a receiver that has not been powered up -- and the row is still
there in *Model* -> *Telemetry*, with nothing to say it is stale.

Asked for such a row, the radio answers **zero**, not "no value". Zero is a perfectly good
reading, so a stale row can be mistaken for a working sensor that happens to read nothing, and the
value then stays at zero for as long as the model is loaded. For fuel that is the number the
SmartFuel calculation publishes, the callouts speak and the flight log records.

The suite therefore asks a second question of any sensor reading zero, and takes the reading only
where the radio has actually received that sensor. A row that has never arrived is treated as
missing rather than as zero.

**What that question can and cannot separate.** It separates *"nothing has arrived for this sensor
since the model was loaded"* from *"something has"*. It does **not** tell a sensor that fell silent
a moment ago from one that is still arriving: a sensor which stops mid-flight keeps its last
reading, and a link that drops does not undo what has already arrived. That is the radio's own
behaviour, not something the suite can see behind.

## What you will see

- **The fuel callout** says nothing for a fuel row the radio is not sending, where it used to
  announce 0 %.
- **The flight log** leaves its minimum-fuel columns empty for such a flight instead of filling
  them with a zero that was never measured.
- **The dashboard is unchanged.** Every telemetry value it keeps starts at zero and is only
  overwritten by a reading that arrived, so a value with no sensor behind it shows `0` there
  before and after. Making those tiles show `--` is a separate gate and this is not it.

## When the choice is made again

The sensor chosen for a value is forgotten in three places, and it is worth knowing which,
because they are not the same event:

- **The dashboard widget** forgets the choice on its own link edges, so a session that begins
  after a reconnect matches everything again from the top of its list. That matching is spread
  over the first few reads -- normally no more than four values start their search in one pass,
  and the arming state is not held back -- so after a reconnect the dashboard's values appear
  over about two seconds rather than all on the first read, and somewhat later where other
  readers in the same pass start searches of their own. The same applies when the widget starts.
- **The configuration tool** forgets the choice on every audio tick (five times a second) for as
  long as it does not consider the connection ready -- no link quality, no battery reading, or
  no flight controller answering -- and so matches again from the top each time. Once it is
  ready, the choice stays until that test fails again.
- **The radio's own telemetry reset** -- which happens when a model is loaded, when the radio is
  switched on, and on *Reset Telemetry* -- is what puts the sensor rows themselves back to "never
  received". That is the event the zero test above is measured against.

A link that merely drops does neither of those to the rows: what has already been received stays
received until one of the resets above. So a model flown with a different ESC, or with a value
switched on since, picks up the right sensor when it is next loaded rather than in the middle of
a session.
