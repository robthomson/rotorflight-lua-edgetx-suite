-- Setup assistant: the first setup of a bare flight controller.
--
-- The unit is a PROCEDURE, not a wizard step. A procedure has a precondition, a goal, a
-- completion criterion it derives from the machine, and one or more screens; it is the thing that
-- can be run on its own two months later when one setting changes. The sections -- radio, flight
-- controller -- are orientation and progress, never navigation: the pilot is told *Radio, 3 of 6*,
-- not *step 7 of 12*.
--
-- Three rules shape everything below and are worth stating once rather than at each screen:
--
--   A procedure owns a decision or a check only if it can FINISH it. Where a value depends on
--   something a later procedure sets, the decision belongs there and not here behind a
--   placeholder.
--
--   Every intermediate state the assistant leaves behind must be harmless on its own. The pilot
--   may leave at any point, and does -- going out to correct something in the radio is a designed
--   route, not an abort.
--
--   A screen must fit without scrolling. On a page that ASKS, a row scrolled out of sight is an
--   option the pilot never knew was there, so where the content would not fit the procedure gets
--   a second screen instead.
--
-- And one that is about honesty rather than about shape: completion is DERIVED from the machine on
-- every entry. Only what the machine cannot know is stored -- see `store.lua`.

--
-- The margin does NOT scale with it. It is not spacing: it compensates for the page reporting a
