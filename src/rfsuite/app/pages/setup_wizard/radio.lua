-- Channels the assistant lays out, in the order it walks them.
--
-- A channel carries a LIST of roles rather than one, on both sides, and the simplification that
-- it carries exactly one fails on real layouts in both directions: the documented blackbox
-- channel is one channel driving two mode boxes at two windows, and the throttle channel needs a
-- hold and a governor source at once. Only one role each is populated here, and the shape is a
-- list so that adding the second is data rather than a rewrite.
--
-- `kind` decides which value window is computed and what is written beside the mix:
--   condition  - one position turns a flight controller mode on, the rest leave it off
--   throttle   - two mixer lines, and the firmware has no mode box for a throttle hold at all
--   adjustment - the whole travel is mapped onto a value range, in adjustment slots
--
-- `tier` has four values and the fourth is not decoration: *required*, *recommended*, *optional*
-- and **unavailable** -- a channel the assistant knows about and cannot deliver today. Marking
-- such a channel *recommended* would promise something the run does not keep.
-- `input`, `inputName` and `channelName` are the layout itself rather than decoration on it. The
-- source belongs in the INPUT and the mixer line carries nothing but that input: writing the
-- switch straight into the mixer line produces the identical channel value and is not the same
-- setup, because it leaves the input list empty and the transmitter then shows nothing at the
-- place the configuration belongs to. A layout whose channels are called CH5..CH8 is one nobody
-- can check by looking, either.
--
-- The two name lengths differ and neither is generous: a colour radio stores four characters for
-- an input name and six for a channel name. These are chosen to fit rather than to be truncated
-- by the radio afterwards, because a truncated name would never again equal what the completion
-- criterion compares it against.

-- the same setup -- it leaves the input list empty, so the pilot's own radio shows nothing where
-- the configuration is supposed to be.
--
-- The order is the flight controller's, not the transmitter's. A radio at its factory setting
-- carries RETA, and this layout is roll, pitch, collective, yaw -- so on a fresh model two of the
-- four inputs have the wrong source and the assistant is what puts them right.

-- differently it means another stick or does not exist. What has to come out right is the
-- RESULT: roll on channel one, whatever it is called here.
--
-- `field` is the name the FIRMWARE knows a control by, and it is deliberately not one of the
-- names beside it. EdgeTX generates it from the target's own hardware description and its own
-- documentation says so in as many words: the names `getFieldInfo` takes are not the names shown
-- on the radio's menus. So it is neither the label the pilot edits nor one that moves when the
