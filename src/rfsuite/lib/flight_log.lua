-- Flight log data core.
--
-- Two files under the user directory, both meant to be readable and editable off the radio:
--
--   flights.csv    append-only, one line per flight. The header is written when the file is
--                  created and never again, so a line appended to an existing file carries no
--                  header of its own. A line is
--                    date,time,model,battery_id,flight_s[,<statistics columns>]
--                  and the statistics columns are optional: a five-column line is valid and is
--                  what this suite writes today.
--   batteries.cfg  the pilot's own battery registry, one pack per line,
--                    id=<unique>;name=<label>;cap=<mAh>;models=<name,name|*>;profile=<1-6>;
--                    cycles=<n>;last=<YYYY-MM-DD>
--                  `#` starts a comment line, `models` empty or `*` means every model, and a
--                  duplicate id is resolved in favour of the first line carrying it.
--
-- Every write to the registry is line surgery, never a regeneration: only the edited line
-- changes and comments, unknown fields and the file's own line endings survive byte for byte.
-- The replace is atomic (write `.new`, verify its size, park the original as `.bak`, rename),
-- because this is a file the pilot maintains by hand and a truncating in-place rewrite that is
-- interrupted loses all of it.
--
-- io.write answers the file handle on success and nil plus a message on a short write, so a
-- failing write is not silent. Every write here is verified through fstat all the same, by the
-- number of bytes the file grew: that is the stricter check and it is independent of what the
-- call reported, since the size is what the card actually holds afterwards.
