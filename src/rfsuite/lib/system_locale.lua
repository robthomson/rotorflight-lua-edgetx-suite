--- Forget the answer, and tell everyone who memoised it.

-- that an answer is wrong, only that it might be. So a language changed in the settings needs a
-- second signal, and a settings save is exactly that.

-- This is that signal, and it is the one invalidation point in the suite. The dashboard's
-- preferences reload calls it; the generation counter moves; the theme commons and the object
-- layer re-resolve on their next call rather than on the widget's next restart. Without it the
-- window alone leaves every locale memo that outlives a single call holding the old language for
-- as long as the Lua state lives, which is what the object layer's own memo did.
--
-- Deliberately a FIELD and not a function: its readers sit on a path a reactive closure walks,
-- and the whole cost of the check has to be one table index.
