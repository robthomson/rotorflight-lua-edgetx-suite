-- OnConnect task: put the craft name the flight controller reports onto the radio's model,
-- when the "Synchronize Model Name" setting asks for it -- and put the model's own name back
-- when the link goes.
--
-- Runs after the `name` task in the manifest, which is what fills session.modelName.
--
-- The rename is TEMPORARY: the name the model had is remembered before it is overwritten and
-- restored when the craft goes away, so a pilot who flies one model with a craft plugged in does
-- not find it permanently renamed afterwards. The name is remembered in two places on purpose.
-- The module-local is what the in-session restore uses, so that path can never depend on a store
-- being reachable; `lib/model_name_store.lua` is the backstop for the cases the local cannot
-- cover, and it is a separate file because it has to be readable with nothing connected.
--
-- Restoring is NOT this task's job, and cannot be. M.reset() below reads as the disconnect hook
-- and is not reached: the runner drops a task's module the moment isComplete() returns true
-- (`releaseTaskModule(task, false)`), and the disconnect path, `resetQueuesAndState()`, opens with
-- `if not task.module then return end` -- so it returns before it can call the reset it came for.
-- This task completes on its first pass, every time, so that is every time. The module-local
-- below goes the same way: a second connect loads a fresh module and inherits nothing.
--
-- So the restore is a STATE rather than an event. The events runtime puts the name back from the
-- store on a tick that has established there is no craft, which covers the completed-task case
-- above, a link that drops while nothing happens to be looking, and a cold start.
