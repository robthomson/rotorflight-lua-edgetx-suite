-- Put a model name back that the disconnect hook never got to.
--
-- `model_name_sync` restores from its own reset, and that reset is reached only through
-- publishConnected(false) -- i.e. only where something was ticking at the moment the link went.
-- Nothing is ticking when the radio is switched off with a craft still connected, so the model
-- comes back up wearing the craft's name and no event is ever going to say so. The reading side
-- therefore cannot be an event: it is a STATE, checked on a tick that has established there is no
-- craft, which a cold start reaches on its first pass.
--
-- The cost on that tick is the context check below and one boolean. The store answers hasAny() from a flag after its first
-- call, and everything past it -- reading the model, writing to it, touching the card -- happens
-- only where a rename is actually outstanding.
--
-- Only in the context that renames. `model_name_sync` is a `widget` task
-- (tasks/events/onconnect/manifest.lua), so the configuration tool never writes the craft name,
-- and it must not take it off either. While a standalone tool is open EdgeTX runs no widget, so a
-- link that drops and comes back in that time is seen by the tool alone: a restore from the tool
-- puts the model's own name back and spends the record, the tool's reconnect cannot write the
-- craft name again, and the widget, resuming with the link up, has seen no disconnect and does
-- not either -- the model keeps its own name while the craft is connected. A link that is still
-- down when the tool closes is seen by the widget on its next ticks, and a cold start reaches a
-- widget tick like any other, so every case above still has a state that restores.
--
-- One case is left without one: a model that no longer carries the dashboard or the service widget
-- when the link goes, or when the radio starts. Its record stays on the card and the model keeps
-- the craft name until one of the two widgets is on it again, which puts the name back on its first
-- tick without a link; a rename in between takes the recorded name, not the current one, as the
-- original (tasks/events/onconnect/tasks/model_name_sync.lua).
