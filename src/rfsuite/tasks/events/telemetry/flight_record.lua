-- The flight record: the statistics of the flight in progress and of the flight before it.
--
-- Owner. This runs from the event runtimes, in the widget context only, so the record is kept by
-- whichever widget runs the suite's background work: the dashboard, or -- on a model that does
-- not use the dashboard -- the service widget, which is there to run the runtimes and publish the
-- MSP surface for other widgets. There is no election to make and none is needed: one widget of
-- the suite runs that work, and anything else in the same Lua state reads the finished record out
-- of the session table. A model without a dashboard therefore still records its flights.
--
-- Arm edge. One definition, the event runtime's: the armed state the onarm and ondisarm chains
-- already fire on (tasks/msp/runtime.lua, the ARM sensor). The record opens on that arm edge and
-- closes on that disarm edge, as the first task of either manifest, so anything reading the
-- record at the disarm edge -- the flight log among them -- sees the finished flight in `last`.
--
-- The published schema, and this is the whole of it:
--
--   rfsuite.session.flight = {
--     current     = { <key> = number, ... },  -- the flight in progress, empty until a value lands
--     last        = { <key> = number, ... },  -- the flight that ended, empty before the first one
--     seconds     = number,   -- armed seconds of the flight in progress
--     lastSeconds = number,   -- armed seconds of the flight that ended
--     flights     = number,   -- flights the flight controller counts
--     totalSeconds= number,   -- armed seconds the flight controller counts, plus the live flight
--     armed       = boolean,  -- whether a record is open
--   }
--
-- The keys of `current` and `last` are the statistic's own, built from the table below: `maxRpm`,
-- `minVoltage`, `maxEscTemp` and so on. A key is absent until the statistic has taken a value, so
-- a reader asks `current[key]` and falls back to `last[key]`.
--
-- `current` is mutated in place while a flight runs -- every field is independently monotonic, so
-- a reader between two passes cannot see a torn value -- and is REPLACED by a fresh table on each
-- edge, which is how the dashboard's own derived snapshot is swapped for the same reason.

-- What "powered" means, and it is asked about a statistic that records a FLOOR and about the
-- headspeed band kept per PID profile.
--
-- A minimum taken across the whole armed window is a minimum of the spool-up and the spool-down
-- rather than of the flight: a pilot arms first and spools up afterwards, so the first readings
-- inside an armed window are the lowest ones that window will ever carry, and they stay the
-- minimum for the rest of the flight. The maxima keep the broad window on purpose -- nothing
-- about a ramp can raise them, and a reading taken outside the powered band is still the
-- highest the flight reached.
--
-- A headspeed extreme kept PER PID PROFILE is gated on both ends instead: it is a statement
-- about what the governor held under that profile, so a reading taken while the governor was
-- not holding anything belongs to no profile in particular.
--
-- The flight controller's own governor state is the reading that says when the rotor is under
-- power at a settled headspeed, and two of its ten states qualify:
--
--   4  ACTIVE    the governor is holding the requested headspeed
--   9  BYPASS    the governor is bypassed and the throttle curve drives the head directly
--
-- Every other state is a ramp or is not driving the head: throttle off (0), throttle idle (1),
-- spool-up (2), recovery (3), throttle hold (5), autorotation (7) and bailout (8) all carry a
-- headspeed or a current below anything the flight holds. Fallback (6) is left out for a
-- different reason: the flight controller enters it when the motor rpm signal has failed, so a
-- headspeed sampled there is not a headspeed.
local POWERED_GOVERNOR_STATE = {

-- The governor state is only maintained for the modes that run a governor state machine. With
-- the governor off, or limiting the throttle only, the flight controller leaves the state at the
-- value it was initialised with, so a gate on the state alone would take no minimum at all on
-- those models -- and on a model whose receiver is not sending the state sensor either. The
-- state is therefore trusted only once a value inside its own range has been seen in this
-- flight; until then the gate is what a model without a governor still has, which is that the

-- fallback cannot tell such a reading from flight, so the last 2 s of a driven stretch never
-- count. This is the depth of the four readings each powered tracker holds back (p1..p4). The

-- The raw readings of a sampling pass, offered to a second reader in the SAME pass.
--
-- The event runtimes are driven at the top of a widget's pass, ahead of that widget's own
-- telemetry read, so on a sampling pass this record asks the sensors first and the dashboard
-- then asks for most of the same names a second time. The read is what those passes cost, and
-- the second one cannot answer anything the first did not: a pass runs to completion without
-- yielding, so a telemetry value does not move inside it.
--
--   rfsuite.session.telemetryRead = {
--     values = { <sensor name> = number, ... },  -- this pass's raw answers
--     pass   = number,  -- counted by the READER, once per pass, before the runtimes are driven
--     at     = number,  -- the pass `values` was filled in
--     now    = number,  -- the reader's clock for this pass, in seconds, set with `pass`
--     reads  = boolean, -- whether the reader's read falls due in this pass, set with `pass`
--   }
--
-- `values` is the sensor's own answer, raw -- before the rounding, the watts inference and the
-- fuel clamp below, so a reader applies its own derivations and keeps its own numbers. A name
-- the sensor answered nothing for is absent, which is what Sensors.getValue returns and what a
-- reader has to see. So is a name that was not asked at all because SmartFuel handed its value
-- over in this state: the dashboard's read takes that hand-over ahead of the sensor too.
--
-- The table is created by the reader and by nobody else, so a record with no such reader -- a
-- model that runs the suite's background work from the service widget -- publishes nothing and
-- pays one comparison for the offer it never makes.
--
-- `at == pass` is what makes an offer this pass's. A wakeup from anywhere else in the same Lua
-- state -- a second widget's background work -- stamps the pass before it, and the reader counts
-- the next one before the runtimes are driven again, so a stale fill can never match.
--
-- An offer is only taken if the record samples on a pass that reads, and its own 0.5 s clock
-- starts at the arm, in whatever phase of the reader's 0.5 s read that happens to be -- and with
-- both at the same interval, that phase then holds for the whole flight. So while a reader is
-- counting passes the record takes its `now` and `reads`: it samples on the passes on which the
-- read falls due, and measures its interval on the reader's clock: the reader's `now` is taken at the top of the pass
-- and the record's own a little later, and a tick between the two would otherwise put a sample one
-- pass ahead of the read. The interval still applies, so a reader that says `reads` on every pass
-- -- one that skips its read and so never moves its clock -- does not make the record sample on
-- every pass. A table whose `now` is older than one interval has no reader counting any more, and
-- then, as without a table, the record keeps its own clock.

--- Read the tracked sensors. A sensor that answers nothing leaves the previous reading standing,
