-- EdgeTX MSP API: ANALOG (battery and link readings from the flight controller)
-- Reference module: no shipped page loads it. It is kept for the developer API tester, which
-- loads a module by its name, and as the starting point for a page that needs this message.
--
-- Nine bytes, and the voltage appears twice: byte 1 is the legacy 0.1 V reading kept for older
-- consumers, bytes 8-9 the 0.01 V one that should be used. Values are passed on exactly as the
-- firmware sends them, with the scale of each stated beside it, because the display each caller
-- wants differs and rounding here would take that decision away from it.
--
-- What the readings mean depends on the meter sources the battery configuration names: with the
-- source set to ADC these are the board's own measurements, and only with it set to the ESC do
-- they come from there. The reading alone does not say which.
