-- One save mechanism: writes -> EEPROM commit -> optional reboot -> reconnect -> reload.
--
-- Architectural Reboot Policy (Rotorflight 2 Lifecycle):
-- In Rotorflight 2, whether a reboot is required after saving comes down to whether hardware
-- drivers, DMA streams, timer allocations or core structures require full re-initialization
-- during board boot, vs runtime tuning parameters that are live-updated in memory:
--
-- 1. Reboot Required (Hardware drivers, DMA streams, timer allocations & core architecture):
--    - setup/ports: UART re-initialization, baud rates, DMA channels.
--    - setup/radio_config: Serial/SPI RX protocol drivers and hardware binding.
--    - setup/esc_motors (throttle, rpm, telemetry): DShot/PWM hardware timers, bidirectional
--      DShot DMA, and telemetry pin configurations.
--    - setup/alignment: Gyro/accelerometer sensor orientation matrices and low-level driver re-init.
--    - setup/configuration: Loop rates, system feature flags, and core task scheduler sizing.
--
-- 2. Conditional Reboot (Mixer structural changes vs geometry tuning):
--    - setup/mixer/swash: Reboots only if swashplate geometry type changed (swashTypeChanged).
--      Rate/direction changes are live runtime math and do not trigger a reboot.
--    - setup/mixer/tail: Reboots only if tail rotor mode changed (tailModeChanged, e.g. servo vs
--      motorized). Trims, yaw rates and limit adjustments do not trigger a reboot.
--
-- 3. No Reboot (Runtime tuning, mathematical filters & control loops):
--    - flight_tuning/advanced/filters: In RF2, gyro/D-term filter coefficients and state structures
--      are dynamically re-calculated in RAM upon MSP write without needing a reboot.
--    - flight_tuning/governor: Gains, feedforward, and target headspeed tables are active runtime tuning.
--    - flight_tuning (pids, rates, autolevel, rescue, etc.): Live in-memory updates.
--    - setup/servos (pwm, bus) & controls: Live trim/center/range updates (except servo PWM rate,
--      which takes effect at the next boot).
--    - setup/model: Profile / model metadata changes only.
--
-- Note on MSP_STATUS.reboot_required: Although MSP_STATUS carries a reboot_required flag,
-- the firmware's MSP set-handlers do not currently set it (only CMS does). Therefore, the
-- suite explicitly defines and orchestrates this reboot policy on the client side.
--
-- Every page that ends a save in MSP_EEPROM_WRITE builds its own chain of nested queue:add
-- calls, each next step queued from the previous step's processReply. The pages that
-- append MSP_REBOOT queue it with an empty processReply, so the reboot is fire-and-forget:
-- nobody waits for the flight controller to come back, the page keeps displaying values the
-- board re-derived in validateAndFixConfig() while it was booting, and the save is reported
-- finished before its longest phase has started.
--
-- A page hands this module a descriptor instead and stops owning the process:
--
--   SavePipeline.start({
--     pageId = "setup_configuration",
--     steps  = {
--       { label = "...", command = NameApi.writeCommand, payload = ... },
--       ...
--     },
--     reboot = true,                              -- or false, or function() -> boolean
--     invalidateSessionKeys = { "setup_configuration" },
--     onDone = function(result) ... end,
--   })
--
-- Progress is exposed through getProgress() and drawn by whoever is on screen, which is the
-- same split the start screen uses for the connect chain. Nothing here opens a native modal,
-- so the tool's run() and the MSP tick keep going for the whole pipeline.
