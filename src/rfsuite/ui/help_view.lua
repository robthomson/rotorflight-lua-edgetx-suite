-- The help text is a page of its own, built the way the menu pages in ui/home.lua build theirs.
-- A `page` node is always a full-screen EdgeTX page with its own header: it takes no x/y/w/h,
-- paints over anything built before it, and anything built after it sits on top of its body.
-- So the header is the page's own (title, subtitle, icon), and the text is its body. The sheet
-- is closed by EXIT, or by the header's close icon (`backButton`) on a touch radio; both reach
-- `onBack`, which closes the help while it is open.
--
-- EdgeTX builds a page body that takes no focus, and the rotary encoder and the keys scroll a
-- body only by moving the focus: LVGL scrolls the focused object into view, no further than
-- needed. So a thin marker that can take the focus stands above every line of the text (the
-- help texts give one setting per line) and one more below the last. Turning the encoder
-- moves the focus from marker to marker, one line per step in either direction: forward, the
-- marker comes to rest at the bottom edge with the line above it complete; back, at the top
-- edge with the line below it complete. The focused marker is drawn in the focus colour and
-- shows where the reader is. The first marker takes the focus when the sheet opens, which
-- leaves the text at its start. A marker does nothing when pressed. Touch scrolls the body by
-- dragging, as before.
