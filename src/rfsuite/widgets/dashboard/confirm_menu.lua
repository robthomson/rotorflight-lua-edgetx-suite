-- The question a fullscreen press asks before it is performed, for an entry that carries
-- `confirm` (a quick menu row, or one a theme draws from the same records).
--
-- A view on the stack, above the surface that raised it: the menu stays open under it, and
-- declining puts the menu back exactly as it was. What is drawn here is only the question; what
-- the press does is the entry's `press` and its `after`, held by views.confirm until the pilot
-- answers, and run from this view's ERASE button. Nothing is queued, and full screen is not
-- left, until then.
--
-- It is deliberately the same two layout profiles fullscreen_menu.lua and battery_pick_menu.lua
-- use (large above 350 px, standard below), so a radio at either resolution gets a box of the
-- size it already gets from the menu.
--
-- The strings all come from the entry's `confirm` table, resolved where the entry was built; the
-- only literals here are the fallbacks for a table that is missing one, so a new confirmed
-- entry adds no string to this file.

-- is what makes a theme's own `after`, handed in through ctx.run, act on the menu as well.
