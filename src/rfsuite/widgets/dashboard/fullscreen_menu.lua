--- Run an entry, or one of its options: the work, then the action that follows it. This is the
--- one place both happen, for the menu's own buttons, the picker's and a theme's alike.
--
-- The work is the option's when an option is given and the entry's otherwise; so is the action,
-- unless `after` names another one. `report` is handed to the work, which tells it how the
-- messages it queued fared (see queueChain); the menu's own buttons pass none.
--
-- An entry that carries `confirm` is a press that must be agreed to first: its work is NOT
-- performed here but handed to the confirmation view (views.confirm), which runs it from the
-- pilot's answer. A question that cannot be raised leaves the press unperformed -- refusing
-- loses nothing where a mis-tap would lose the logs.
--
-- A `choice` entry's own `confirm` guards every option it runs; an option that carries one is
-- held by its own question, which is preferred where both carry one.
--
-- This runs whatever it is handed: the `press` of the table it is given, with no check of where
-- that table came from. A caller resolves first and passes only the menu's own records -- the
-- menu's buttons and the picker take theirs from M.entries / M.entry, and anything a theme hands
-- in goes through M.resolve (as ctx.run in views.lua does). A caller that skips that step lets a
-- theme put work of its own behind one of the menu's entries.
