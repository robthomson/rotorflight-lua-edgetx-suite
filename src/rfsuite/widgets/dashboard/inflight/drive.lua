-- The in-flight tuning drive: what the overlay does to the radio, and when it is allowed to.
--
-- The flight controller's stepped adjustments are reached through two global variables that a
-- mixer line each puts on the enable and the value channel. This module owns those two writes and
-- nothing else. It never speaks MSP -- tasks/msp/runtime.lua clears its own queue on every armed
-- tick, so a write attempted in flight would be dropped without a word -- and it never writes the
-- model: mixer lines, global variable details and trim modes are CHECKED here and reported, never
-- authored.
--
-- Everything that touches the radio goes through the small table `M.radio()` returns, so the
-- state machine can be driven under a plain Lua interpreter with those functions replaced.
--
-- The safety rule the whole file is built around: the value variable is 0 whenever no pulse is
-- running and nothing is held, including after EVERY way out of the overlay. `cleanup` is cheap
-- and idempotent for exactly that reason -- it is run on every transition away rather than on the
-- one transition that happened to be observed.

--- The adjust trim, read as an EDGE and answered with a PULSE.
--
-- Why it is not the level, which is what this was. A trim is a momentary contact and a pilot's
-- press on one lasts as long as a pilot's press: the two in his own log are 0.0 and 0.1 seconds
-- long. The flight controller counts no step at all until the value channel has stood STILL
-- inside one window for TRIGGER_DELAY, 100 ms (fc/rc_adjustments.c) -- so a relay that wrote the
-- magnitude while the trim was down and 0 when it came up made the channel move out and back
-- without ever standing still. Short press: no step, and nothing on the screen to say why. Held
-- for a second: three or four. That is the pilot's report exactly -- it works "only after a
-- while, and very inaccurately".
--
-- So one press is one pulse, which is what the touch control has always done: the magnitude goes
-- on at the edge and stays on for `pulse_ms` -- until the first pass at or after it -- however
-- early the trim is let go. The cool-down after a pulse is the same length, so two presses closer
-- together than the board can tell apart are one step and not an arbitrary number of them.
--
-- And one press is ONE pulse however long the trim is held: a held trim does not repeat, and a
-- new step needs the trim to come up and go down again. A trim is read once per widget pass, and a
-- pass only sees whether it is down at that instant -- so a release and the next press that both
-- fall between two passes read as one continuous hold. With the magnitude kept on the wire for as
-- long as the trim read as held, the board's own REPEAT_DELAY turned every 200 ms of that reading
-- into a step: on a radio running the widget at a few passes a second, a quick series of taps
-- stood on the wire for seconds and stepped many times more often than the trim was pressed.
-- Ending the pulse on its own clock bounds what one press can do whatever the pass rate. Holding
-- to repeat stays with the touch controls, whose release is reported by an event rather than
-- sampled.
--
-- The pulse is the trim's OWN, deliberately not the touch control's. A held touch button is
-- published as `holding` and freezes the widget's render key, because a rebuild would delete the
-- object that reports its release; a trim has no object and a rebuild cannot lose it, and
-- freezing the surface for as long as a thumb is on a trim would freeze it for the whole of the
-- tuning.
--
-- A press and a release move no epoch. `valueEpoch` is in the widget's render key, so a bump
-- here tore the tuning surface down and built it again on every trim press and every release,
-- and nothing on that surface had changed: the snapshot carries no field derived from trimRow or
-- trimUp, and the screen reads neither. Where a trim does change what the surface shows -- in
-- `rows` mode, the trim of another row selects that row -- `self.row` moves, and the row is in the

--- The per-model store, re-read off the card when the file on the card has moved.
--
-- WHY THE OVERLAY DOES ITS OWN. The guard was written against a module-level cache in
-- lib/model_preferences.lua that nothing invalidated: the tool that saves the settings file runs
-- in a different Lua state (`lsWidgets` is its own `lua_newstate`, not a coroutine of the main
-- one), so a save refreshed the TOOL's copy of that cache while the widget's still held the file
-- as it stood at connect, and the widget's own preference watcher handed back a brand-new table
-- containing the old content. That cache is gone -- `loadByMcuId` reads the disk on every call.
--
-- The guard stays for two reasons that outlive it. It is the path the overlay's
-- settings-to-widget behaviour was measured on, and it does not depend on the runtime's own
-- reload, which is deliberately held back while armed, while the widget is off-screen and after a
-- flight with no link -- the states the overlay is live in.
--
-- So the overlay looks at the file itself. One `fstat` a second while the feature is enabled; on a
-- change, one forced read that goes to the disk. Nothing of theirs is touched and
-- `widget.modelPreferences` is left exactly where it was -- their theme reload still reads what it
-- always read -- because a fix that reached into their state would be a second writer of it.
--
-- THIS GUARD IS THE MODEL HALF'S ALONE. The radio's settings live in the radio's own preferences
-- file, and the runtime already watches that one and hands the new table down; opening a second
-- watcher on it would be the very duplication the paragraph above refuses. Only the per-model
-- store is stat'ed here.
--
-- And what it is gated on is the RADIO's switch, not the combined answer. The model's switch is
-- IN the file being stat'ed, so gating the stat on it would mean a model switched on from the
-- tool is never noticed by a widget that has already read the store once.
