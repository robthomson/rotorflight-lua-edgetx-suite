-- The flight controller's adjustment functions, and the channel geometry that reaches them.
--
-- Rotorflight drives its stepped adjustments from two RC channels: one arms a slot (the enable
-- channel) and one carries the step (the value channel). fc/rc_adjustments.c accepts a step only
-- after the value channel has stood still inside one window for TRIGGER_DELAY, so every control
-- on the tuning screen is a PULSE to a fixed magnitude and never a movement.
--
-- Nothing in this file probes. It is a table and arithmetic, so the widget pass, a reactive
-- closure and a settings page can all read it.

-- Their packager rewrites every literal t("widgets.dashboard.<key>", "FALLBACK") call site into
-- the locale being built (bin/package/build_package.py, .vscode/scripts/precompile_i18n.py). In a

-- which is what the simulator and the offline accounting run see.

-- Every adjustment function the firmware exposes, with the value range their own adjustments
-- page uses. The names are the ones that page shows, so a parameter reads the same wherever the
-- pilot meets it (app/pages/setup/controls/adjustments/page.lua, ADJUST_FUNCTIONS).
--
-- `cmd`, `api` and `field` say where the CURRENT value of that parameter lives: the MSP command
-- that answers it, the module under tasks/msp/api that decodes the reply, and the name that
-- module's parse gives the value. The overlay reads a value once, on the ground, and then follows
-- it through the board's own AdjF/AdjV report -- those two sensors carry the last adjustment that
-- fired and nothing else, so without this table a parameter would only have a number on screen
-- after the pilot had already turned it.
--
-- Ids 30 and 31 are deliberately absent: YAW_COLLECTIVE_DYN and YAW_COLLECTIVE_DECAY have no
-- ADJ_ENTRY in 4.6 firmware, so a slot naming them can never fire and a row offering them would
-- promise a step that is not made. Id 4, OSD_PROFILE, has a command and no field: their
-- osd_config parse stops before the profile byte, so nothing here can read that one back.

-- documented line would be a silent change to a configuration somebody else wrote down.
--
-- The six added cells have no documented line to be equal to, so they take the range their own
-- adjustments page offers for the same function.
--
-- THE STEP IS THE PILOT'S, not this table's. It used to be part of the record -- 5 for the
-- documented thirty and 10 for the head speed -- and the pilot's ruling after the third radio
-- round is that ONE setting decides it for the slots the setup action writes. So the numbers
-- below carry bounds only, and `M.DEFAULT_STEP` is what a caller that names no step gets: the
-- documented 5, so a caller written before the setting existed still asks for the documented
-- line.

-- the set is bounded above 250 -- the documented thirty at 10..200, the five other fills at
-- 0..250 -- so a step chosen to make a gain move by a feelable amount is useless on
-- it: five rpm a press is two thousand presses across the range. It carries a SECOND setting of
