-- The in-flight tuning overlay's ground half: what it reads off the flight controller before a
-- flight, and the undo it lays down before the pilot turns anything.
--
-- Everything in this file speaks MSP, and MSP is only spoken on the ground. tasks/msp/runtime.lua
-- clears its whole queue on every armed tick and pump() refuses while armed, so a read started in
-- the air is dropped without an answer and a write is lost silently. This module therefore
-- refuses to start while armed and abandons a run that is armed into -- and it treats the queue's
-- own "cleared" reason as that abandon rather than as a failure, because the clear IS the runtime
-- enforcing the same rule.
--
-- It does NOT attach a client of its own. Runtime.attach() records the id and brings the runtime
-- up, and widgets/dashboard/runtime.lua's tickMspRuntime already does both on every pass, along
-- with the tick and the pump these replies arrive on. Nothing in the queue schedules by client id
-- -- it is one FIFO, and the id is what a clear and a log line name -- so a second registration
-- would add an id that something would afterwards have to detach, and the widget has no teardown
-- point that could. The messages still carry `client`, which is the part that has an effect.
--
-- Two things are read off the board rather than assumed. The SET is the board's own adjustment
-- slot table: which parameter sits in which bank and row is whatever the pilot configured there,
-- and the documented layout is only the fallback for a board that yields nothing usable. The
-- VALUES are the nine reads that between them answer every adjustment function id, so the screen
-- can show a number before the first step is made -- AdjF/AdjV only report what has just moved.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The phases
--
-- A reply is STORED when it arrives and PARSED on a later widget pass, at most one per pass.
--
-- The firmware bills a widget call at 20 000 VM instructions (lua_widget.cpp, MAX_INSTRUCTIONS)
-- and the LVGL reactive sweep of the tree standing after the call comes out of the same 20 000,
-- on top of a background pass that already costs eleven and a half thousand. One reply of this
-- run parses for between 42 and 933 of those, so the question is not what a reply costs but how
-- many of them one pass can be made to carry -- and the answer used to be "as many as the link
-- delivers". The widget pass gives the MSP queue two turns (Runtime.tick and Runtime.pump,
-- widgets/dashboard/runtime.lua), a read the queue finds in its cache completes with no round
-- trip at all, and a retry can still be answered after its replacement has gone out. A bounded
-- pass may not rest on none of that happening.
--
-- So `processReply` copies the bytes, stores them and returns, and `M.tick` -- once per widget
-- pass -- parses exactly one stored reply. The worst pass carries one parse however the link
-- behaves.
--
-- What does NOT move is the request that follows. The next command is known from the run's own
-- cursor for every phase but one -- only the function-id reply says which slots are worth reading
-- -- so the chain is continued from the ARRIVAL, in the same queue turn it was continued from
-- before. That keeps the wire timing the one this module was measured with against a board: the
-- request goes out on the queue's second turn of the same pass, and its answer is picked up by
-- the first turn of the next one. Moving the send to the parse instead would put every request on
-- the first turn, where the custom-telemetry drain runs between the send and the second turn --
-- and lib/crsf.lua buffers a frame only for a type its OWN instance has been asked for, while the
-- drain and the MSP transport load that file separately and hold an instance each.
--
-- The copy is not avoidable. tasks/msp/common.lua reassembles every reply into one table and
-- clears it when the next reply's first frame arrives; the queue hands that same table to
-- `processReply` and to its read cache. The MSP runtime's own periodic reads share that
-- transport, so between the pass a reply lands on and the pass that parses it the buffer can
-- already hold somebody else's answer. A copy is a fraction of a parse -- one element loop over a
-- reply of 1 to 43 bytes, 17 to 143 instructions against 42 to 933 -- which is what makes the
-- trade worth making.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- How many replies may wait for their parse at once, before the chain waits for the parse.
--
-- A pass parses one reply and gives the queue two turns, so a link that answered both of them
-- would store two replies for every one parsed and the backlog would grow for the whole run.
-- Past this depth the arrival does not ask for the next command; the parse does, which is one
-- reply in flight per parse and cannot grow. On a link that answers one request per pass -- which
-- is every real one, and the offline check in bin/accounting too -- the depth never reaches it.

  -- The pilot's ruling after the third radio round: the interlock is the one entry, so turning it
  -- on before a flight is the moment the backup should exist -- not a button he has to remember
  -- on the flight line. The drive raises the request on the interlock's rising edge and knows
  -- nothing else; this is where the link, the arm state and the prime are known, and every
  -- refusal the button has applies here unchanged and lands on the same line of the screen.
  --
  -- Once per session and per ACTIVE PID profile, and the existing backup is what says so: it
  -- records the profile it was taken from, so a second interlock cycle on the same profile finds
  -- one already made and sends nothing, while a profile change makes the next cycle take a fresh
  -- one. No counter of its own, and nothing to reset.
  --
  -- THE REQUEST IS A STATE AND NOT A SIGNAL, and that distinction is a defect this round
  -- measured rather than reasoned about. The first cut cleared the flag on the line above the
  -- test below it, so an interlock thrown while the values were not yet read consumed the
  -- request and made no undo at all -- silently, for the rest of that interlock cycle. It is a
  -- pilot-plausible sequence and it was measured: a momentary arming on the bench cleared the
  -- MSP queue, the value re-read came back `abandoned`, and the interlock forty seconds later
  -- produced nothing. So the flag stands until a backup is actually asked for, or until there is
  -- one for this profile already, or until the phase leaves the ground -- which is where the
  -- drive clears it, on every transition that is not into `ground`.
