-- The three renderings of the in-flight tuning overlay: the widget zone, fullscreen, and the
-- ground surface between flights.
--
-- All three append node tables to `children`, the idiom widgets/dashboard/fullscreen_menu.lua
-- uses, so the runtime builds them exactly the way it builds the quick settings menu.
--
-- The layout is the concept drawing's, and it is laid out in FRACTIONS of the widget's own zone
-- rather than in constants: the reference is 480 x 272, the pilot's radio is 480 x 320 and the
-- large radios are 800 x 480, and a surface a pilot reads at arm's length in sunlight cannot have
-- a row list that runs off the bottom of one of them. Only the fonts step, because the firmware
-- offers a ladder of five and not a size.
--
-- The zone screen carries NO buttons. Whether an LVGL button in a non-fullscreen widget zone ever
-- receives a press is not something this file knows, and a control that may or may not answer is
-- worse on a tuning screen than no control at all: there the pilot's trims are the input and the
-- screen is the read-out.
--
-- What is reactive here is what the FLIGHT CONTROLLER moves -- the value, the value it stepped
-- from, the six row values, the active row's colour and the lines that expire on the clock -- and
-- every one of them reads the precomputed snapshot on `widget.state.inflight` and nothing else.
-- Everything else is laid down at build time and replaced when the render key moves. The division
-- is not a style: the board answers a step while the radio is still holding the pulse that asked
-- for it, and a rebuild in that window costs the pilot a second step he did not ask for. That is the rule from
-- GEMINI.md: a closure handed to lvgl.build runs per frame, on whatever instruction budget
-- refresh() left over, outside the widget's own pcall.

-- that must never happen is a pilot mistaking it for the dashboard. A theme whose accent is the

-- simulator at 800 x 480 -- and every vertical stack below is built from them. They are the box

-- bottom of the screen. So text that cannot fit is cut here instead.
--
-- MEASURED on a rendered frame, per font, and not derived from the height by one ratio: the
-- small font runs about 8.5 pixels against a box 14 tall and the middle one about 15 against a
-- box of 30, so one ratio over-estimates the larger fonts by a third and cuts titles that fit.
--
-- Each figure is the WIDEST average a string of that font was measured at, not the mean one --
-- `Yaw CCW Stop` runs 10.1 pixels a character where a lowercase sentence runs 8. A budget set at
-- the mean cuts most strings correctly and lets the capital-heavy ones wrap, which is the failure
-- it exists to prevent; set at the maximum it cuts a few strings a character early, which is not
-- a failure at all.

-- long as the surface was up -- and in the air that is every couple of seconds, for a verdict
