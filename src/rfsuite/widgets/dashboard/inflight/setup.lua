-- plus the setup check and the model write, and needs them WITHOUT the live state machine and
-- without the adjustment-function tables behind it. Keeping them in one file cost the settings
-- page the whole of `drive.lua` and `functions.lua` on entry -- measured at 114 kB of Lua on a
-- desktop interpreter, against 0.1 to 3.9 kB for the project's other settings pages -- on a radio
-- whose tool had 134 kB of heap left. So the split is not tidiness: it is the page's memory.
--
-- Everything that touches the radio goes through the small table `M.radio()` returns, so a radio
-- that does not offer one of those calls makes this file say less rather than raise.

-- reference layout on those channels is about to lose thirty mixer lines -- which is a reasonable
-- thing to agree to and never a reasonable thing to discover afterwards. So the lines that would
-- go are listed one by one, named as the mixer page names them, and counted in the sentence the
-- confirmation asks its question with.
--
-- The plan is also a COMPARATOR, and that is what keeps it from being a rewrite. Everything it
-- queues is something this model does not already carry: a variable whose details differ, a channel
-- that does not carry exactly the one line, a flight mode that still trims a claimed trim. A plan
-- that queued them unconditionally asked the pilot to confirm a delete-and-reinsert of the very
-- line its last run had written, on every press, on a model the check beside the button had just
-- called correct. When nothing is left to queue it says so through plan.nothing.
--
-- `trims` is the resolved trim block, the same one M.check takes: without it a stored trim SETTING
-- is a switch position that cannot be turned into the semantic number the firmware's trim-mode
-- table is indexed by, so no trim fault could be answered -- which is how the trim half of this
-- plan came to be unreachable for every trim the check can raise a fault about.
