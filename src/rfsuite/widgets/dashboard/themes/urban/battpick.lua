-- The battery picker this theme draws for itself.
--
-- M.layout draws it, and pickview.lua is what calls it on a host with theme views: the host's
-- `battery_pick` record turned into a spec. M.build fills the same spec from a widget's
-- `state.batteryPick` for a host that calls a theme's `batteryPick(children, widget)` hook; the
-- phase modules of this theme export no such hook.
--
-- It is a one-shot build: every string is a constant computed in this function. Nothing of
-- the picker runs in the firmware's reactive sweep, which is the cheapest way to satisfy
-- the reactive-closure rule rather than the carefully memoised way the flight view needs.
--
-- What the theme may write back is fixed by the host contract, and it is all this file
-- does: a press sets `widget._batteryPickRequest` to the entry's id (`false` for "no
-- battery"; nil is the host's "nothing was pressed"), the close box calls the host's
-- `rfsuite.batteryPick.dismiss()` or, where
-- that is not published, sets `widget.state.batteryPick.dismissed` itself, and both leave
-- fullscreen. In particular the `widget.built = false; widget.renderKey = nil` reset the
-- stock fullscreen menu performs is deliberately NOT done here -- the contract says nothing
-- else is written to the host, so the host keys its own rebuild off `pending`/`dismissed`.

-- The picker's picture, apart from what its presses do and where its strings come from: the
-- `spec` names the title, the close box's press, the packs in registry order (`name`, `sub`,
-- `selected`, `press`) and NO BATTERY (`label`, `selected`, `press`). M.build below fills it
-- from the widget for the host hook; pickview.lua fills it from the host's `battery_pick`
-- record, so the two pickers are one drawing.
--
-- The header is the one every view of this theme draws (viewkit.lua, K.header), from the
-- screen's top left corner. The packs stand in two columns from two packs up, each a cell with
-- the pack's name one face above the flight view's and its line (M.detail) in that face.
-- NO BATTERY always gets a full-width row of its own at the foot, reserved before the pack grid
-- is measured so it can never be the entry that falls off the bottom. It holds one line, so it
-- is only as tall as that line or the close box, whichever is taller, and the pack cells get
-- the rest.
--
-- Where the packs need more rows than the room above NO BATTERY holds, the grid scrolls: the
-- cells keep the size they have when the room is full, and every row stands in a `box` the size
-- of that room, which the firmware scrolls in full screen -- by a swipe, and by the rotary
-- encoder, whose focus moves from button to button and brings the focused one into view. Every
-- pack can then be reached and picked; NO BATTERY and the header stay where they are. The box
-- takes no option beyond its geometry: the firmware's defaults scroll it in both directions,
-- which is vertical only here because the rows are never wider than the box, and show a scroll
-- bar while there is more to see, for which the cells leave a strip at the right.
