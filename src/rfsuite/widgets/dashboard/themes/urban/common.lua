-- Shared drawing helpers for this theme.
--
-- The theme is free-form: flight.lua and postflight.lua export a build(zone, state) that
-- returns the LVGL node list itself instead of a layout/boxes grid, which is the branch
-- widgets/dashboard/runtime.lua takes where it tests type(self.theme.build) == "function".
-- Everything below therefore appends nodes with absolute coordinates to one flat list -- no
-- nesting, so no node's position depends on a parent's.
--
-- Three cost classes, and every helper here belongs to exactly one of them:
--
--   build  runs once per rebuild, in a JOB pass of its own together with the host's MSP pump
--          quantum and the FIRST reactive sweep of the new tree. Geometry, font selection and
--          every firmware probe (lcd.sizeText, getValue, io.open) happen here, never in a
--          closure; the render key repeats only the one read it needs. A rebuild is triggered
--          by the render key alone, so the build's cost is paid exactly as often as the key
--          moves.
--   sweep  the function fields handed to lvgl.build (text, color, size) run in the firmware's
--          reactive sweep, per frame and outside the widget's own pcall. They read `state` and
--          nothing else, they probe nothing, and they format one string per value change --
--          M.getter is the shape, and a closure that is not a getter still keeps to the rule.
--   key    the render key runs every 0.5 s inside the host's STATE pass, the pass that is
--          already the most expensive one the widget has. It reads what the build read, and
--          nothing that a closure could read instead.

if type(_G) == "table" and type(_G.__rfsuiteThemeUrbanCommonModule) == "table" then
  return _G.__rfsuiteThemeUrbanCommonModule
end

local M = {}

-- The shipped default theme's helper is deliberately NOT loaded here. It would supply the
-- cell-count estimate and the duration format, and it costs a whole module -- its own i18n
-- machinery included -- executed in the STATE pass that reloads the theme, which is the pass
-- the connect chain runs in. The two functions are restated below, to the letter of the
-- shipped ones, so the theme loads nothing outside its own folder.

-- sensor names beside them are not words and stand as they are. The source catalogue in
-- layout.lua keeps its own labels because the configure page lists them as options, and those
-- two must stay one list.
--
-- Where the suite already names the same thing in the same case, its key is used rather than a
-- second one: the flight-log viewer's column names, the flight statistics' total, the audio
-- events' governor states, the status page's arming-disable reasons.
