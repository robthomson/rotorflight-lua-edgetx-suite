-- Free-form phase module for the flight view, before and during a flight. init.lua names
-- this one file for both `preflight` and `inflight`: the panel reads correctly armed or not,
-- and a layout that changes under the pilot at spool-up is harder to read than one that stays.
-- The host still reloads the theme on the mode change, as it does for every theme; what it
-- reloads is the same module, cached, and the rebuild it triggers is a warm one.
--
-- The runtime takes the theme.build branch and hands the returned node list straight to
-- lvgl.build. Everything is in layout.lua; this file is the host's entry point and nothing else.

-- The telemetry this view reads that no box of this theme names -- which for a free-form theme
-- is all of it, since a free-form theme declares no boxes for the host to walk. Without this,
-- a value row showing one of the host's derived readings would find an empty snapshot and draw
-- "-" for ever.
--
-- It is a FUNCTION rather than a list because the answer depends on what the pilot put in the
-- five rows: the host calls it once per theme load, with the state, after it has resolved this
-- theme's configuration -- so the list is built from the slots that are actually on screen.
--
-- It belongs to this module and not to the statistics one, and that is what the host makes the
-- list per phase for: the statistics view reads the frozen flight record instead, so a reading a
-- pilot put on the flight screen stops being read the moment the flight is over.
