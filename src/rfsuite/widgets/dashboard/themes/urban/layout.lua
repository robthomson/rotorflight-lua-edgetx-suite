-- there, the arrangement is here. Both are loaded once per Lua state and cached on _G, the

-- one require and a few forwards.

-- Extending the theme -- where a change goes, and what it costs:
--
--   a new value the five rows can show     one entry in L.SOURCES; the configure page and the
--                                          panel both read that list, nothing else changes.
--   a new panel or a new box in a panel    a build-time function here appending nodes; every
--                                          moving field a Common.getter over `state`; every
--                                          firmware probe at build time, never in a closure.
--   a new build-time reading               a term in L.renderKey -- with a dead band where the
--                                          reading is continuous, or the panel rebuilds on noise.
--   a derived quantity (a latch, a peak,   NOT here. A theme has no per-pass entry point but the
--   a decoder, a sag detector)             render key, and that runs inside the host's most
--                                          expensive pass. Derivation belongs on the host's
--                                          `state` or flight record; the theme draws it.

-- adds for a row a pilot chose. A row without one reads a fixed field of the state and costs the

-- asked for it, so the slot half of the list is built from the five slots a pilot actually
-- chose. None of the five defaults carries a `source`; the readings the theme declares whatever

  --
  -- THIS ROW KEEPS THE RECORD, AND THE STATUS LINE ABOVE IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. The host
  -- publishes both readings; the line takes `esc_status_live` and this row takes `esc_status`,
  -- so on a controller that faulted and recovered the two say different things at the same time.
  -- That is the design and not a bug to tidy away: the line answers "what is wrong now" and would

  -- is wrong. One cut per value change, in the format path, never per frame.

  -- truncation. Twelve of the widest capital is the bound the cut actually guarantees. It costs

-- every theme load and again on every phase change, with the module being drawn -- which is why
-- it belongs to the flight view and not to the statistics one. The statistics view reads the
-- flight record, so a reading a pilot put on the flight screen costs nothing once the flight is
-- over.
--
-- Two halves. The readings the flight view draws whatever the five slots say:
--
--   esc_status_live, esc_status_live_level   the speed controller's LIVE status, which the
--                                            status line reads. Declared unconditionally: a
--                                            declaration built from the slots alone would
--                                            leave it unresolved on every radio whose pilot has
--                                            not put it in a row, and the line would then say
--                                            nothing for a reason no pilot could ever see.
--   TQly, TPWR                               the transmitter's link quality and power, for the
--                                            TQ bar and the bottom bar.
--   link_floor                               the sensitivity floor of the air rate, which the
--                                            signal bars measure their headroom against.
--   link_diversity                           whether a second antenna has been seen.
--   *Skp                                     the skipped-frame count, which the suite publishes
--                                            itself (tasks/events/telemetry_bg/drain.lua,
--                                            setTelemetryValue 0xEE02). A bare `Skp` is not
--                                            declared: no current source creates it, and an
--                                            absent name is still a read on every pass.
--
-- And the `source` of each row a pilot put in one of the five slots.
--
-- BOTH names of the live pair are declared, and the second one is not redundant even though the
-- host pairs them itself: that pairing runs as a pass over the collected list, so it only sees a
-- declaration collected BEFORE it. If the order of those two steps ever reversed, the level would
-- go undeclared, the severity would arrive as nil, and the status line would fall back to READY
-- on a model with a faulty controller, with nothing going red. Naming it costs a table entry the
-- host would have added anyway, and it turns an ordering assumption into no assumption at all.
--
-- `esc_status` -- the worst reading since the flight controller connected -- is NOT in the first
-- half. It is the ESC Status value row's reading, so it arrives through the slot loop when a
-- pilot selects that row, and a pilot who has not selected it does not pay for it.
--
-- That is a cost on the HOST, per snapshot, and it is stated rather than hidden: each name is
-- resolved on every snapshot, an absent one is searched again on the host's back-off of 2 s
-- rising to 30 s, and `link_floor` makes the host ask the transmitter module once per link which
-- ExpressLRS generation it runs. A host without `sources` support resolves none of it, and those
-- cells read "-" while the status line falls through to the arming reasons and READY.
--
-- Duplicates are dropped here rather than left to the host: two slots showing one reading is a
-- thing a pilot can do, and the list is a declaration, not a count.

-- reads with a few hundredths of jitter -- and every flip is a full rebuild of the tree,
-- in flight as much as on the ground. So the step only moves once the reading is more than
-- 0.15 V from the centre of the step it is on: 0.05 V past the boundary, never on it.

-- Everything that moves is a reactive closure, so the tree only has to be rebuilt when its

-- figures are sized from, the model picture, and the TX battery the pill was painted from.
-- Without a key of its own a free-form theme is built once and never again, and a model
-- change would leave the previous picture up. A slot change needs no term here: the
-- preference watcher reloads the theme and clears `built` itself. The phase is in the key
-- although the host reloads the theme on every mode change -- one tostring, and the key then
-- stays right on a host that stops doing so.
--
-- The battery pick's `pending` is a build-time reading for the same reason: the B-Profile
-- label's colour is a constant of the build, so without the term the warn colour would never
-- clear. The picked pack is not a term: nothing drawn depends on it.
--
-- This runs every 0.5 s inside the host's STATE pass: one sensor read, no table allocation,
-- no probe of the card or the settings. What a build reads beyond this (the radio's battery
-- range, the image on the card) is read at build time and is not a term.
