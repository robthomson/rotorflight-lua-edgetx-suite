-- The suite's tool, opened from the dashboard widget and run inside it.
--
-- EdgeTX gives a widget no way to start a tool script, so the dashboard does not start one: it
-- loads `ui/home.lua` into its own Lua state and drives it from `widget.refresh` for as long as
-- it is open. `ui/home.lua` returns `{ init, run }`, the same contract the radio drives a tool
-- script with, and paints itself with lvgl.clear() and lvgl.build(), so a fullscreen widget can
-- carry it unchanged. Opened with `init({ hosted = true })`, it leaves alone what the dashboard
-- in this state already owns -- the module cache, the event runner, the card sink, the audio
-- engine and the global table -- and it shares the dashboard's MSP runtime rather than bringing
-- a second one, so there is one client on the link and the connect chain is not run again.
--
-- Two things differ from the tool script, and both are the radio's rather than this file's:
--
--   * A tool script is yielded when a call runs long; a widget call is stopped at the instruction
--     limit. A page that builds a lot in one call is therefore stopped part-way here, which is an
--     ordinary event for a page written for the tool script. The step below catches it and runs
--     the tool again on the next pass, and the page completes over several of them. A raise that
--     escapes the catch reaches the widget's entry point, which backs off as it does for any
--     other pass (src/widgets/rfsuite/main.lua).
--   * The tool's modules stay in this state's module cache after the tool is closed. The
--     dashboard's own modules are in the same cache, so the cache cannot be emptied; only the
--     entries the dashboard never uses -- the pages and the tool's interface -- are dropped.
--
-- What the tool loads is loaded as the tool script loads it, because the tool script's loader is
-- not the radio's: src/main.lua puts a wrapper over loadScript that reads the bytecode beside a
-- file when it is current and keeps a shared module's chunk for as long as the tool runs. The
-- pages load themselves and most of what they use with loadScript(path, "t") and rely on that
-- wrapper; without it every page here, and every file it loads that way, would be compiled from
-- source on every visit, and the bytecode the radio writes beside each file never read back. The
-- same loader is therefore put in place while the tool is open and taken away when it closes
-- (see installLoader below).
--
-- The tool is closed by its own closing sequence wherever that can still run: the back key at
-- the top of its menu, the model arming, and fullscreen being left. Arming closes it because
-- while it is open it runs in place of the dashboard's pass, and the dashboard's pass is what
-- makes the callouts. A widget sent to the background cannot paint and is dropped at once.
--
-- Loaded on the first press that opens the tool, never on a pass that does not.
