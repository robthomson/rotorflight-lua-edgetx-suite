-- The dashboard widget's fullscreen views: which surface fullscreen shows, and what follows a
-- press on one of them.
--
-- A view is a module with `build(children, widget)`, and optionally `renderKey(widget)`, that
-- draws the whole fullscreen tree. A free-form theme may register views of its own and replace
-- the look of the widget's (see `register` below); a theme's module has `build(children, zone,
-- state, ctx)` instead, like the rest of a theme. Which one is on screen is a bounded stack of
-- view ids on the widget, `widget._viewStack`, lying above a base layer:
--
--   * the top of the stack is what fullscreen shows;
--   * with the stack empty the base layer shows. `widget._viewBase` names it: `"theme"` while the
--     active theme has asked for fullscreen (`fullscreen = "theme"` in its init.lua), which the
--     runtime then builds at the fullscreen size, and nil otherwise. With no base layer and an
--     empty stack the default view -- the quick menu -- is shown, which is what fullscreen has
--     always shown on entry.
--
-- The stack is one field, so that the pass which arrives without an event -- fullscreen has
-- been left, possibly by a long press on RTN that Lua never saw -- drops all of it in one
-- assignment in widgets/dashboard/runtime.lua. The same table is the fullscreen session: what
-- else belongs to one visit to fullscreen -- the outcome of the work a theme ran -- is kept on
-- it, beside the views, and goes with it. Once a visit has one, it stays a table while the
-- visit lasts, empty or not.
--
-- What follows a press is data rather than code. An entry, an option or a button carries an
-- `after` action; its `press` does the work only, and `navigate()` below performs the follow-up.
-- `navigate()` is therefore the one place a view leaves fullscreen from. The in-flight tuning
-- surface is not a view here -- it takes fullscreen ahead of all of them -- and keeps its own
-- close box.
--
-- Loaded on the first fullscreen pass, never on a zone pass -- except that of a free-form theme
-- that registers zone views, whose conditions are asked here -- and by the rfsuite.batteryPick
-- handle when something calls it. Nothing here is module state: the registry and the stack live
-- on the widget, so a second copy of this module would change nothing.

-- and never opens a view -- what an unresolvable condition does in `app/menu_registry.lua` as
-- well.
--
-- Only the vocabulary an entry or a view actually uses is resolved. `enabledWhen` and
-- `lockedWhileArmed` are part of the same manifest vocabulary and nothing sets one, so the
-- first entry that needs one brings its resolver with it. `confirm` is the first that did, and
-- its resolver is not a condition but the confirmation below: an entry that carries one is
-- held by `M.run` until the pilot has answered.
--
-- A condition that opens a view is cleared by whoever set it when the view is answered or

-- is closed while its condition is still true stays closed until the condition has fallen and
